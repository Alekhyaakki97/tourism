# Efficient Tour Planning System
  Tourism, the act and process of spending time away from home in pursuit of recreation, relaxation and pleasure. Tourism may be international, or within the traveller's country or a state. It is to travel for pleasure and the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Most of the customers prefer to plan their tour in online systems and need an effective plan. 
  Planning a route before starting the travel is a common requirement of a tourist. This becomes a necessity where more and more people tend to travel to unfamiliar places in local and non-local regions .Tourist will search for a simple route between two locations and try to take the best route. The best route can be the quickest, shortest, or most scenic route, depending on the location chosen.
  Travelling within the destination may involve visiting several Places Of Interests, restaurants, hotels etc. which needs to be visited in one tour. Here the POI’s are nothing but the places to visit in the journey by the travellers. Personalization in choosing the POIs is allowed to the travellers i.e., we provide the customers with the different types of packages. They are:
* i.General package
* ii.Seasonal package
* iii.Customised package

In this work, the users can plan for their tour and choose their personalized tour i.e., according to their choice of interest through the customized package that we are providing. The user is enlisted with several POI’s to visit for their tour. They can choose their customized POI’s for several places. The system is efficient to the user since it is designed in such a way to make the personalized tour. It is designed with the consideration of giving the customized trip to all the people by considering the requirements of the customers.
